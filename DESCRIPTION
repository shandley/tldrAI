Description: Provides concise, practical help for R functions using Large Language Models while 
    maintaining the brevity and example-focused philosophy of tldr. 'tldrAI' 
    connects to AI models (like Claude, OpenAI) to generate helpful, practical 
    examples and explanations for R functions without the verbosity of traditional
    documentation. Features include multi-provider support, fallback mechanisms,
    offline mode, contextual awareness that personalizes examples based on the user's 
    environment, customizable character voices that add personality to the
    generated help text, and visualizations that illustrate function behavior.
