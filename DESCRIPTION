Description: Provides concise, practical help for R functions using LLMs while 
    maintaining the brevity and example-focused philosophy of tldr. 'tldrAI' 
    connects to AI models (like Claude, OpenAI) to generate helpful, practical 
    examples and explanations for R functions without the verbosity of traditional
    documentation. Features include multi-provider support, fallback mechanisms,
    offline mode, and customizable character voices that add personality to the
    generated help text.
