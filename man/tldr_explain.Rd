\usage{
tldr_explain(
  code,
  detail_level = "basic",
  highlight = TRUE,
  line_by_line = FALSE,
  specific_lines = NULL,
  context_aware = FALSE,
  voice = NULL,
  refresh = FALSE,
  provider = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{code}{Character string containing R code to explain, or a file path
to an R script.}

\item{detail_level}{Character string specifying the level of detail in the explanation.
Options are:
\itemize{
\item "basic" - Simple, high-level explanation (default)
\item "intermediate" - More detailed explanation with some technical details
\item "advanced" - In-depth explanation with detailed technical information
}}

\item{highlight}{Logical indicating whether to include syntax highlighting in the output.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{line_by_line}{Logical indicating whether to provide a line-by-line explanation.
Default is FALSE. When TRUE, explains each significant line or block individually.}

\item{specific_lines}{Character string specifying a range of lines to explain (e.g., "5-10").
Default is NULL, which explains the entire code.}

\item{context_aware}{Logical indicating whether to use context awareness. When TRUE,
examines your R environment to provide a more relevant explanation. Default is FALSE.}

\item{voice}{Character string specifying the character voice to use. Use
tldr_list_voices() to see available options. Default is NULL (uses the configured default).}

\item{refresh}{Logical indicating whether to ignore cached results and generate a fresh response.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{provider}{Character string specifying the LLM provider to use. Options are "claude" (default)
or "openai". Requires API key to be configured for the selected provider.}
}
\value{
Prints formatted explanation to the console and invisibly returns the raw response
as a character string. The returned object has attributes that can be accessed with attr():
\itemize{
\item "provider": The LLM provider used ("claude" or "openai")
\item "voice": The character voice used (if any)
\item "context_aware": TRUE if contextual awareness was used
}
}
\description{
This function analyzes and explains R code, providing a detailed explanation of what
the code does, how it works, and why it's structured the way it is. It's useful for
understanding complex code, learning R, or documenting your own code.

# Explain code from a string

# Explain code from a file

# Different detail levels
tldr_explain(code, detail_level = "basic")

tldr_explain(code, detail_level = "advanced")

# Line-by-line explanation
tldr_explain(code, line_by_line = TRUE)

# Explain specific lines
tldr_explain(code, specific_lines = "2-3")

# Use context awareness for more relevant explanations
library(dplyr)

tldr_explain(code, context_aware = TRUE)

# Apply a character voice
